# 👋 Hi there! 

🚀 Welcome to our GitHub profile — This space is dedicated to building intelligent **digital twin system** that interface robotics with AI for real-world impact.
Our aim is to create a digital twin of an industrial robotic arm that can autonomously detect, classify, and pick up plastic waste using computer vision and reinforcement learning in a simulated environment.

### 🧠 Current Focus:  
**Digital Twin for Plastic Trash Detection & Robotic Handling**  
A simulated and physical environment where:
- 🦾 An industrial robotic arm (e.g., Franka Emika) is used to detect and pick up plastic waste
- 📷 RGB cameras + YOLO-based object detection are used for identifying recyclable materials
- 🤖 Isaac Sim powers the 3D simulation of robotic interactions
- 🧠 PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) handles reinforcement learning for intelligent movement
- 🔁 Observations → Actions → Joint Actuation pipeline closes the feedback loop

### 💡 Vision  
To create sustainable, AI-powered automation tools for **environmental clean-up** and **waste sorting**, enabling industries and smart cities to adopt robotics at scale.
